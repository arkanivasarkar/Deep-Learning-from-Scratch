# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of deep learning networks from scratch. It project was developed as a part of the programming exercises of the **Deep Learning** course offered by the [**Pattern Recognition Lab**](https://lme.tf.fau.de/) at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t (FAU)**.

The codes are written in *Python* using object oriented programming concepts such as, *inheritance* or *polymorphism*. All fundamental layers, activation and loss functions, optimizers and regularizers are implemented by coding the corresponding mathematical operations using *NumPy* only, without the use of any deep learning frameworks.

## Methods
The project is implemented in three parts as mentioned below. `NeuralNetwork.py` imports all layers and functions and runs them. `NeuralNetwork.py` contains unit tests for each and every layer and function to check if the implementation was properly done.



The main class running everything is `NeuralNetwork.py`. Various unit tests for every layer and function are included in `NeuralNetworkTests.py`.

Detailed descriptions of implementation, along with methods and mathematical formulations can be found inside `Protocols`.
